MICA INVIZ Thesis
======
I am a neuroscientist with a background in neuroimaging using MRI. This project was 
created for my thesis project for my Information Visualization Masters program at the 
Maryland Institute and College of Art. I am exited to create something that is truly 
helpful to people working with neuroimaging(MRI) data.
